# 🔐 crypto-lab

A small Rust project for practicing basic cryptography concepts.

🧪 This is where I experiment with:

- ✨ Caesar ciphers
- ✨ Substitution methods
- ✨ More encryption & decryption logic soon

🔧 Built with:

- Rust 💻
- Love 🩵
- Chaos 😈

> Not a serious crypto tool — just learning, exploring, and breaking things on purpose (sometimes).
